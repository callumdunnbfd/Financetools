            <strong>Plain English:</strong> Some links are affiliate links. If you click and take a qualifying action, we may earn a commission.
            This does not usually increase your cost.
          </div>

          <h2>How affiliate links work</h2>
          <p>
            When you click an affiliate link, the destination provider (or their affiliate network) may use tracking (for example, cookies or similar
            technologies) to attribute your visit to us. If you later complete a qualifying action (such as an application, eligibility check,
            sign-up, or purchase), we may receive a commission.
          </p>

          <h2>Does this cost you more?</h2>
          <p>
            Typically, no. Affiliate commissions are generally paid by the provider. Your price is usually the same whether you use our link or not.
          </p>

          <h2>How we choose what to show</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>We aim to show options relevant to the calculator result (for example, reducing interest or improving savings rate).</li>
            <li>Compensation can influence which partners we feature and how links are presented.</li>
            <li>We do not guarantee eligibility, acceptance, pricing, or outcomes.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Not financial advice</h2>
          <p>
            We provide tools and general information only. We do not provide personalised financial advice.
            Consider your circumstances and, if needed, seek advice from a qualified professional.
          </p>

          <h2>Partner responsibility</h2>
          <p>
            Partner websites are responsible for their products, offers, eligibility checks, application processes, and compliance obligations.
            Always review their terms, fees, and conditions before applying or purchasing.
          </p>
